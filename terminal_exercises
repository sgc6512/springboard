1. Shows a detailed manual containing descriptions of what the command and it's flags do. You scroll with Enter and get out with Q.
2. -l uses a long list format which shows more info. -a shows hidden files and folders.
3. Ctrl + arrow keys
4. Ctrl + e
5. Ctrl + a
6. Ctrl + w
7. Terminal is the program that runs the shell, the shell is the command line interpreter/interface.
8. The strict path to a file ie "C:/Users/Me/Documents/File.txt"
9. The relative path is the path to a file from where you are already. If you were in the Documents directory above the File.txt path would just be /File.txt
10. A flag is an optional additional command you can use when using the terminal. I've used -a and -l with ls to display more info, and in -r in rm to remove file directories
11. -r removes the directory and contents of it, -f forces the command to run, and doesn't prompt file deletion
